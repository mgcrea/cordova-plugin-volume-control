# [Cordova Volume Control](https://github.com/mgcrea/cordova-plugin-volume-control) [![Release](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/cordova-volume-control.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/mgcrea/cordova-plugin-volume-control/releases)

This plugin provides a simple way to interact with the volume of your `UIWebView`.

* This plugin uses private `AVSystemController.h` APIs and can't be used for AppStore apps.

* This plugin is built for `cordova@^3.6`.

* This plugin currently supports iOS.


## Plugin setup

Using this plugin requires [Cordova iOS](https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios).

1. `cordova plugin add cordova-volume-control`


## Javascript interface

    // After device ready, create a local alias
    var VolumeControl = cordova.plugins.VolumeControl;

    VolumeControl.toggleMute();
    VolumeControl.setVolume(0.15);

* Check [source](https://github.com/mgcrea/cordova-plugin-volume-control/tree/master/www/VolumeControl.js) for additional configuration.
